# CMIS242.Project1
First project for my CMIS 242 class.

Completed 01 September 2020.

Projec1.java will compute the minimum, maximum, and average of a collection of Weight objects.
The Weight class contains variables for pounds and ounces and methods to add to, divide, and compare weights.

Also included in this repo is the original assignment, test files, and testing results turned in for grading. I received a 100% for this assignment.

Don't cheat on your assignment!
